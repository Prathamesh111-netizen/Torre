# Torre

## Requirements:

☑️ Construct a page allowing users to search for names, displaying a list of matching individuals. Take inspiration from **[the torre.ai search](https://torre.ai/search/people-name)**.

☑️ Additionally, please implement ***one or both*** of the following features:

- Display a list showcasing up to 10 of the most recent search queries.
- Provide an option for users to save or favorite individuals and ensure this list is easily accessible.

☑️ Upon clicking a search result, users should be directed to their genome. This can be either directly on [torre.ai](http://torre.ai/) or through your own implementation. Your choice!


## Deliverables

Please provide links to:

- The live, production-ready environment where we can test your implementation.
- A version control system that will allow us to review your incremental progress.
